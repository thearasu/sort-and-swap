# Sort and Swap
I have created this project for a interview task. It is not intended to be professional and have not follwed any best practices. Feel free to make changes.

## Technologies used:
PHP, JavaScript, HTML, spectre.css, JSON

## Functionalities:
1. This project is having a list of products with product name, price, color and subject
2. We can swap the product position from the admin dashborad and it will sort the product order in the home page.
3. If we add a new product, it will added at the end. If we give a sort order to that product, it will move the existing product to the last.

## Considerations:
1. This project is not at all secure. I have not created any authuntication method. Admin panal is openly accessable.
2. I have not followed any best practices in mean the to save time and effort. Including, not creating separate files for scripts and avoided fragmentaions.

## File Structure
**admin/index.php** - Index file of the admin dashboard
**index.php** - index file of the Home Page
**products.json** - File that is used to store products data
**oldproducts.json** - If in case products.json got broken copy and paste this content

Happy coding :)
